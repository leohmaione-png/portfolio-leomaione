  With 52% of Brazilians unsure where their money goes, I led the strategy and
  design of a tool to democratize financial health. We moved beyond simple
  tracking to active management, launching a solution that not only organized
  finances but generated a +1,500% surge in active users post-launch, proving
  that financial control can be simple, engaging, and integrated into daily
  life.

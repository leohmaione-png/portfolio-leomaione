  I led the end-to-end transformation of the bank's core transaction feed (16MM
  MAU). By replacing six fragmented legacy timelines with a single, intelligent
  interface, we moved the product from a static list to a dynamic financial
  management hub, driving massive increase in user satisfaction and a 10x
  engagement in Open Finance

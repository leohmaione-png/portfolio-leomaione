  Simplifying the Pix Key registration flow for mass adoption, leading the UX
  strategy for the launch of Brazil's instant payment revolution within PicPay.
  In a volatile environment with weekly regulatory changes from the Central Bank
  (Bacen), I orchestrated a design strategy that balanced strict compliance with
  a frictionless user experience, securing high usability scores in a critical
  "race for principalship" market.

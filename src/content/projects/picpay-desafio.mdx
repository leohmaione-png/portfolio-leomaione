  Facing a scenario where 80% of users consumed only one product, I led the
  design strategy to unlock the ecosystem's full potential. Leveraging
  behavioral economics, we shifted the value proposition from simple
  transactions to a gamified journey. By reframing incentives, we aimed to drive
  users toward the "4-product active status," historically proven to reduce
  churn by 200%.
